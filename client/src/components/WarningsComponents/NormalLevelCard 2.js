            On average, people with diabetes should aim to get about half of
            their calories from carbs. That means if you normally eat about
            1,800 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight, about 800 to 900
            calories can come from carbs. At 4 calories per gram, that's 200â€“225
            carb grams a day.
